# Unity Game
This is a relatively simple Unity Game functionally similar to the popular online game Run, a 3D platformer & endless runner.

<h6>Due to this project not only did I gain familiarity with the Unity Engine and game creation, I acquired 
knowledge and proficiency of programming in C#. I also added additional features to this endless runner game
such as score counting based on distance traveled, Level Complete/Restart functionality, camera control, etc.</h6>
